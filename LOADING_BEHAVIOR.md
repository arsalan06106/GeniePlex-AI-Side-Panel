# Loading Behavior Documentation

## User Experience Flow

When the GeniePlex AI Side Panel extension is activated, the user experience follows this optimized sequence:

### 1. **Immediate Display** (0ms)
- ✅ **Navbar shows instantly** - The toolbar with all AI service buttons is immediately visible
- ✅ **Loader is visible** - A Material Design circular loader is displayed in the content area
- ✅ **No blank screen** - Users see the interface structure immediately

### 2. **Background Initialization** (asynchronous)
- Settings are initialized to apply toggle visibility
- Navbar handlers are set up (click, drag-drop, scrolling)
- Split view manager initializes
- Initial AI service URL loads in iframe

### 3. **Content Loading**
- The loader remains visible while the AI service iframe loads
- Loader text shows which service is loading (e.g., "Loading ChatGPT...")
- Once the iframe content is loaded, the loader fades out
- Subsequent AI service switches show loader only if the iframe isn't cached

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
```html
<!-- Navbar is in DOM from start -->
<nav class="toolbar" id="toolbar">
  <!-- AI service buttons -->
</nav>

<!-- Loader is visible by default -->
<div class="loader" role="status" aria-live="polite">
  <svg class="circular-loader">...</svg>
</div>
```

### CSS Behavior
```css
/* Navbar is visible immediately */
.toolbar {
  visibility: visible !important;
  opacity: 1 !important;
}

/* Loader is visible by default */
.loader {
  display: flex; /* Visible from start */
}
```

### JavaScript Initialization
```javascript
// 1. Settings initialize (toggle visibility)
// 2. Navbar initializes (handlers, UI)
// 3. Split view initializes
// 4. Load initial AI service URL (loader stays visible during this)
// 5. Other features load in background
```

## Benefits

1. **Instant Feedback** - Users immediately see the navbar and know the extension is active
2. **Clear Loading State** - Loader indicates content is being fetched
3. **No Perceived Delay** - UI appears instantly, even if AI content takes time to load
4. **Professional UX** - Matches best practices for modern web applications

## Performance Optimizations

- Navbar elements are in HTML (no JS rendering delay)
- CSS ensures immediate visibility (no FOUC - Flash of Unstyled Content)
- JavaScript initialization is non-blocking
- Iframe caching prevents repeated loaders for the same service
- Deferred initialization for non-critical features (language settings, support messages)

## Accessibility

- Loader has `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for screen readers
- Navbar is keyboard navigable from the start
- Clear visual feedback for all loading states
